\section{Introduction}
This report contains a description of our work for the Game Analytics assignment for the 2014 Data Visualization course.
For this assignment, we were asked to use the provided datasets and the D3 visualization package to investigate the following question: \textbf{\textit{How can we (i) analyze trajectory data in order to give players of Dota 2 significant insights and (ii) visualize it so that they can improve their performance?"}}
In this report, we will first describe our analysis of the dataset and the different options for visualization we considered. Then, we will demonstrate the results of our work.
